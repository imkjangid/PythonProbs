## About Python Programming Language

<img src="https://logos-download.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Python_logo_icon.png" width="500"/>|Python is a **general-purpose, mordern, dynamic, robust, high level** and **interpreted** programming language. It is used in web development, data science, creating software prototypes, and so on. Fortunately for beginners, Python has simple easy-to-use syntax. This makes Python an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.
